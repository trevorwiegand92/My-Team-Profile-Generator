Finished homework assignment for week ten. Creating a team profile generator.

NAME: My Team Profile Generator

The objective of this assignment was to create a Node.js command-line application that takes  information about employees and then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The application uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js

After the user inputs their information for each employee, the html page will display each employee's name, id number, email, role, and github information.
