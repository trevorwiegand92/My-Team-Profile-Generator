Finished homework assignment for week ten. Creating a Team Profile Generator.

NAME: My Team Profile Generator

This is my portfolio website for the eighth homework assignment, and the beginnings of what will eventually become my professional portfolio for future showings of my work and experience. 

The objective of this assignment was to create a quality README using a command-line application to generate one for the user, allowing more devotion to the creator to work on the project. 

The command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application is invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
